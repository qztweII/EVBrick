# EV  Robot
### *Mid at python*

## What we have been doing:

>Day 1: I have been creating the initial code, where I have used some tutorials and guides to figure out how some of this MicroPython works. 

>Day 2: Group members added to the project. Beginning to learn the ins and outs of the lego mindstorms and hoping to code the robot soon.

>Day 3: First bit of code done. Hopefully getting on to testing it soon.
