# EV  Robot
### *Mid at python*

## What we have been doing:

>Day 1: I have been creating the initial code, where I have used some tutorials and guides to figure out how some of this MicroPython works. 

>Day 2: Group members added to the project. Beginning to learn the ins and outs of the lego mindstorms and hoping to code the robot soon.

>Day 3-1: First bit of code done. Hopefully getting on to testing it soon.

>Day 3-2: Finally got access to a USB cable and we are now able to test the robot and our code. From observation, our code is working completely as intended. We shall now start the process of taking over the world >:)

>Day 4: We did some more coding. This included the use of ultrasonic sensors. This will allow our bot to see if it is close enough to a thing. Terence had also figured out how to get the wheels to turn at the same time. 

>Day 5:
