# EV  Robot
### *Mid at python*

## What we have been doing:

>Day 1: I have been creating the initial code, where I have used some tutorials and guides to figure out how some of this MicroPython works. 

>Day 2: Group members added to the project. Beginning to learn the ins and outs of the lego mindstorms and hoping to code the robot soon.

>Day 3-1: First bit of code done. Hopefully getting on to testing it soon.

>Day 3-2: Finally got access to a USB cable and we are now able to test the robot and our code. From observation, our code is working completely as intended. We shall now start the process of taking over the world >:)

>Day 4: Worked on code challenges: 1 meter challenge and backwards circle challenge
